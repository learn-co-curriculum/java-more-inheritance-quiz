# Constructors and Inheritance

Why won't the `Car` constructor compile?

```java
public class Vehicle {
    private String vin;

    public Vehicle(String vin) {
        this.vin = vin;
    }

    public String getVin() {
        return vin;
    }

    public void setVin(String vin) {
        this.vin = vin;
    }
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(String vin) {
        this.setVin(vin);
    }
}
```

## Correct

The `Vehicle` class does not have a no-args constructor.

> Correct! The compiler adds an implicit call `super();` as the first statement in the `Car()` constructor.
> The `Vehicle` class does not have a no-args constructor.

## Incorrect

The statement in the `Car` constructor should be `super.setVin(vin);`

> Incorrect. The compiler adds an implicit call `super();` as the first statement in the `Car()` constructor.
> The `Vehicle` class does not have a no-args constructor.

## Incorrect

The statement in the `Car` constructor should be `setVin(vin);`

> Incorrect. The compiler adds an implicit call `super();` as the first statement in the `Car()` constructor.
> The `Vehicle` class does not have a no-args constructor.
