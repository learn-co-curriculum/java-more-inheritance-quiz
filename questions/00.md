# Constructors and Inheritance

```java
public class Vehicle {
    public Vehicle() { System.out.println("Vehicle()");}
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car() {System.out.println("Car()");}
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Vehicle();
        Car c = new Car();
    }
}
```

What is printed when the `main()` method executes?
